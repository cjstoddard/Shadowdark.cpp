# Shadowdark.cpp

Apparently there are a lot of people out there who do not want to install Python on thier computer for a program they they will use once a month. There are ways to compile Python code into an executable, I did not paticularly like any of them. So I did what I had to do, I sat down and converted the code to C++. This is not a terribly complicated program and it should compile under any recent C++ compiler. As with the Python code, I tried to make this as easy as possible for someone else, wishing to add their own Ancestries and Classes to do so without needing a lot of experience.

shadowdark.cpp - C++ source code

shadowdark.lnx - Linux executable

This project is not meant to be a full fledged character manager, the sole purpose of these programs is to generate Zero level or 1st level characters. The use cases being quick NPC generator, pregenerated characters and lazy players. If you are looking for a more advanced program, I suggest https://shadowdarklings.net/ or https://www.shadowdork.com/welcome-component.
