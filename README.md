# Shadowdark.cpp

Apparently there are a lot of people out there who do not want to install Python on thier computer for a program they will use once a month. There are ways to compile Python code into an executable, I did not paticularly like any of them. So I did what I had to do, I sat down and converted the code to C++. This is not a terribly complicated program and it should compile under any recent C++ compiler. As with the Python code, I tried to make this as easy as possible for someone else, wishing to add their own Ancestries and Classes to do so without needing a lot of experience.

shadowdark.cpp - C++ source code.

shadowdark.lnx - Linux executable, compiled on Debian Bookworm.

shadowdark.zip - Contains the Windows executable and needed dlls.

Example.txt - Example character generated using this program.

This program generate characters for the Shadowdark RPG, the quickstart rules are availble at;

This project is not meant to be a full fledged character manager, the sole purpose of these programs is to generate Zero level or 1st level characters. The use cases being quick NPC generator, pregenerated characters and lazy players. If you are looking for a more advanced program, I suggest https://shadowdarklings.net/ or https://www.shadowdork.com/welcome-component.

Thank you to Kelsey Dionne for creating the Shadowdark RPG, your hard work and creativity is appreciated.

If you are not a programer and the thought of learning C++ and recompiling the code just to make couple of minor changes does not appeal to you, I have a Python version of this program, linked below. The program does require you to install Python, however Python is a more interactive programing language and is much easier to learn. I even include links to help you get started with it.
